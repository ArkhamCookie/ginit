### Credits

Inspired by [Lukas White](https://lukaswhite.com) and [James Hibbard](https://github.com/jameshibbard)'s [tutorial](https://sitepoint.com/javascript-command-line-interface-cli-node-js) about creating cli using NodeJS.<br>
**Note:** The tutorial is pretty out of date, but helpful nonetheless.
